  On an island in the middle of the ocean lives several people of a
  peculiar sort: They are all logicians. And they don't communicate with
  each other. 100 of them have blue eyes, and one of them, the guru, has
  green eyes. The rest have brown eyes. No one knows their own eye color
  (and no one will tell anyone their eye color).

  It so happens to be that at midnight on every night a ferry arrives at
  the island, and leaves shortly thereafter with anyone who knows their own
  eye color.

  One day the guru stands up and says, so that everyone hears:

  "I can see at least one person with blue eyes."

  What will happen? Who will leave the island, and when?

  has been popularized by Randall Munroe on
