  On an island in the middle of the ocean lives several people of a peculiar
  sort: They are all logicians. One hundred of them have blue eyes, while the
  others have brown eyes. The leader of the group, known as the guru, has green
  eyes. It so happens that no one on this island knows the color of their own
  eyes.

  At midnight every night a ferry arrives at the island, and leaves shortly
  thereafter with anyone who can tell the ferryman their eye color.

  One day, the guru stands up and says, so that everyone hears:

  "I can see at least one person with blue eyes."

  What will happen? Will anyone leave the island? Who, and when?

  Please not that no one will tell anyone else their eye color, or communicate
  it in some other. As soon as someone knows their eye color she will leave the
  island with the next ferry - they all want to leave this weird place, after
  all. During any given day, all islanders will see each other, and notice any
  absences.

  It is easier to figure out what would happen if there were fewer people with
  blue eyes.

  We know that there is at least one blue-eyed person - the guru says so. If
  this were the case, the blue-eyed person would see that everyone else has
  brown (or green) eyes, and so she would know that she must have blue eyes.
  She would leave on the first midnight.

  If there were two blue-eyed people, they would both see the other, and know
  that either there is only one blue-eyed person (the other), or there are two,
  and their own eyes are blue. They can't know, but, if there were only one
  with blue eyes, she would leave the first night, as in the previous example.
  Since this doesn't happen, they know that they both have blue eyes. They
  would leave on the second night.

  This process can be continued (inductively) with larger groups of blue-eyed
  people. If there were one hundred blue eyed people they would all leave on
  the hundredth night.

  There are several variations of this puzzle, with different names, including
  Josephine's Problem and The Muddy Children Problem. The most popular version
