  It is dark, and four people need to cross a narrow bridge. Only two can cross
  at a time, and to cross you need to use a torch. The group only has one
  torch. One of the group is quite slow and takes 10 minutes to cross the
  bridge. The others take 5, 2 and 1 minutes, respectively.

  What is the fastest way for the group to cross the bridge?

answer: |
  The fastest way to cross the bridge requires 17 minutes.
