  100 people have died and are now standing in line outside the Devil's gate.
  The Devil has given them each a hat, black or white. No one knows the color
  of their own hat, but everyone can see the hats of the people in front of
  them, e.g. the last guy can see 99 hats, while the gal in front can't see
  any.

  The Devil proceeds by asking the last person in the line:

  "What is the color of your hat?"

  If the person answers correctly, she gets to go to heaven. If she answers
  incorrectly, she will burn in hell for all eternity. The Devil then proceeds
  to the next-to-last, and so on.

  The kind-hearted Devil have, before he put them in line and handed out the
  hats, given them a chance to come up with a strategy to save as many of them
  as possible.

  What strategy should they use? How many can they save?

  Please note, once they have the hats, the only words that may be uttered are
  black and white. Everyone can hear everyone's response.

  Buh!
