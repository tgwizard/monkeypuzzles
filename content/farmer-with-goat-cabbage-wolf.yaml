  A farmer with a goat, cabbage and a wolf is standing on the side of a river.
  They need to cross it, but there is only a small row boat that only can fit
  two of them.

  The goat is hungry, so if the farmer leaves the goat alone with the cabbage,
  the goat will eat the cabbage. The wolf is also hungry, and it will eat the
  goat if they are left alone.

  How should the farmer proceed to get them all across the river?

answer: |
  The farmer and the goat rows to the other side. The farmer rows back and
  fetches the wolf. He brings the wolf to the other side, and then brings the
  goat back. He leaves the goat alone, and takes the cabbage to the wolf.
  Finally, he fetches the goat, and they are all on the other side.
