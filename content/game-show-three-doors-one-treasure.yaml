  You participate in a game show, and the host presents you with three doors.
  Behind one door is one million dollars, behind the others there's nothing.
  The host asks you to choose one door. After you have done so, the host will
  open another door, showing its empty contents. There is now only two closed
  doors left. The host asks: Do you want to choose the other door?

  What should you do to maximise your chances of getting the million dollars?

answer: |
  You should switch doors.
