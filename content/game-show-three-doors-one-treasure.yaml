  You participate in a game show, and in the final contest the host presents
  you with three doors. Behind one door is one million dollars. The other two
  hide sacks of potatoes.

  The host asks you to choose one door. After you have
  done so, the host will open one door - always one of the doors you didn't
  choose, and always one hiding a sack of potatoes.

  Now there are only two doors left - the one you've chosen, and one more. The
  host asks you:

  "Do you want to switch doors?"

  What should you do to maximise your chances of getting the million dollars?

answer: |
  You should switch doors. This can be tricky to see, but the simple thought
  experiment below will prove it.

  The million dollars can either be behind the left, center or the right door.
  Lets assume it is behind the left door.

  First, say that you never switch doors. Then you will get the million
  dollars if you pick the left door, and a sack of potatoes if you pick the
  center or right doors. You have a one in three chance of getting the million
  dollars.

  Second, say that you always switch doors. If you pick the left door, you will
  switch away from the million dollars and get a sack of potatoes. If you pick
  the center door, the host will open the right door - the host always opens
  a door hiding a sack of potatoes - and you will switch to the million
  dollars. The same happens if you pick the right door. This gives you a two
  in three chance of getting the million dollars.

  The is also true if we place the million dollars behind the center or the
  right doors.
