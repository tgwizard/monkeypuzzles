  You participate in a game show, and the host presents you with three doors.
  Behind one door is one million dollars, behind the others there's nothing.
  The host asks you to choose one door, and then he opens another door, showing
  its empty contents. The host then asks: Do you want to choose another door?

  What should you do to maximise your chances of getting the million dollars?

answer: |
  You should switch doors.
