  Martin thinks of a number, 1, 2 or 3. Sophie is allowed to ask Martin one
  question, to which he will answer "yes", "no", or, if he doesn't know the answer,
  "I don't know".

  What question should Sophie ask Martin to uncover his number?

answer: |
  One solution is for Sophie to ask Martin:

  "I'm thinking of 1 or 2. Is your number higher than mine?"

  If Martin has 3, then he will answer "yes". If he has 1, he must answer "no".
  And, if he has 2, he can't know if his number is higher than Sophie's, so he
  must answer "I don't know"

  Another solution is for Sophie to say:

  "Say your number is x. Is the result of 1/(x-2) greater than 0?"
