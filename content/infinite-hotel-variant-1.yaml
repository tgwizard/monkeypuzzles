  The well-renowned hotel of Bilzebab is famous for having an infinite number
  of rooms, and, being such a famous and well-renowned hotel, the hotel is
  fully booked.

  *Ten tourists* arrive at the hotel and ask if there are any rooms available
  for them.

  Bilzebab is also famous for having a smart and quick-thinking manager. The
  manager thinks for a minute, and then says:

  "Yes, of course, I'll just reorganize the current arrangements, and you will
  all get a room".

  In which rooms will the newcomers stay?

  Please note: After the manager has reorganized the room arrangements, no one
  will share a room, no one will be thrown out, and the hotel will still be
  fully occupied.

  Each person, including the one already with rooms, will have to be given a
  specific, calculable, new room number. Saying "go to room infinity plus 1" is
  not valid.

answer: |
  The hotel manager can ask everyone to move 10 rooms up - the person staying
  in room 1 will go to room 11, the one in room 2 will go to 12, and so on.
  This leaves rooms 1 to 10 available for the newcomers.
