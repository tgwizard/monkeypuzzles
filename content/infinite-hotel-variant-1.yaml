  There is a hotel with an infinite number of rooms. They are all occupied.

  **Ten tourists** arrive at the hotel. The tourists ask if they there are any
  rooms for them to stay over the night.

  The hotel manager thinks for a minute, and then says: Yes, of course, I'll
  just need to reorganize the current arrangements, and gives all the arrivals
  a separate room. In which rooms will the newcomers stay?

  Please note, after the reorganizing, no one shares a room, and the hotel is
  still fully occupied.
