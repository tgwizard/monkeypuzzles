  The well-renowned hotel of Bilzebab is famous for having an infinite number
  of rooms, and, being such a famous and well-renowned hotel, the hotel is
  fully booked.

  An *infinite number of tourists* arrive at the hotel and ask if there are any
  rooms available for them.

  Bilzebab is also famous for having a smart and quick-thinking manager. The
  manager thinks for a minute, and then says:

  "Yes, of course, I'll just reorganize the current arrangements, and you will
  all get a room".

  In which rooms will the newcomers stay?

  Please note: After the manager has reorganized the room arrangements, no one
  will share a room, no one will be thrown out, and the hotel will still be
  fully occupied.

  Each person, including the one already with rooms, will have to be given a
  specific, calculable, new room number. Saying "go to room infinity plus 1" is
  not valid.

  The hotel manager can ask everyone to take their room number, double it, and
  move to that room. The person in room 1 will go to room 2, 2 will go to 4, 3
  to 6, and so on. This leaves all the odd-numbered-rooms available - an
  infinite number of rooms. The first newcomer can go to the first odd-numbered
  room (room 1), the second can got to the second (room 3), and so on.
