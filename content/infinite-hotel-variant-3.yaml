  The well-renowned hotel of Bilzebab is famous for having an infinite number
  of rooms, and, being such a famous and well-renowned hotel, the hotel is
  fully booked.

  An *infinite number of buses*, each with an *infinite number of tourists*,
  arrive at the hotel and ask if there are any rooms available for them.

  Bilzebab is also famous for having a smart and quick-thinking manager. The
  manager thinks for a minute, and then says:

  "Yes, of course, I'll just reorganize the current arrangements, and you will
  all get a room".

  In which rooms will the newcomers stay?

  Please note: After the manager has reorganized the room arrangements, no one
  will share a room, no one will be thrown out, and the hotel will still be
  fully occupied.

  Each person, including the one already with rooms, will have to be given a
  specific, calculable, new room number. Saying "go to room infinity plus 1" is
  not valid.

  The solution to this is best described by picturing a matrix, with an
  infinite number of columns and rows. Each row is a bus, and each cell on a
  row is a person in that bus. We can consider the people already in the hotel
  as a zeroth bus - row one in the matrix.

  We can now go in diagonals over the matrix, north-east to south-west,
  starting in the upper left corner. Person (1,1) will get room 1, person (1,2)
  will get room two, person (2,1) room three, and so on.
