  As you walk along a path in a forest, the path splits in two. You do not know
  which way to go. At the junction, two solemn guards stand, ready to help any
  passersby.

  It so happens that the guards only know the words *yes* and *no*. It also
  happens to be that the guards are twin brothers, impossible to tell apart.
  And, as twin brothers, the guards have developed a quite peculiar dynamic:
  One of them always tells the truth, while the other always lies.

  You have one question, which you can ask one of the guards. How do you
  determine how to continue on your path?
