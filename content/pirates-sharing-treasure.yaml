  Five pirates have found a treasure chest of one hundred coins, and are now in
  the process of dividing the treasure among them. As democratic pirates, they
  decide that the oldest of them will come up with a way to share, and then the
  will all vote to accept or reject the plan. If at least half of them vote no,
  the oldest pirate is thrown overboard, and the process is restarted with the
  next-to-oldest coming up with the plan. And so on.

  Perfectly logical and rational, as many pirates are, each of them seek to
  maximise the amount of coins he will get.

  How should the oldest pirate propose they divide the treasure?

  From oldest to youngest: 97, 0, 1, 0, 2.
