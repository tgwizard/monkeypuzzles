  Rebecca and her partner attend an evening party together with four other
  couples. During the initial mingling, everyone greets and shakes hands with
  those they hadn't met before.

  Later in the evening Rebecca asks all nine other party-goers how many people
  they shook hands with, and she gets nine different answers.

  How many people did Rebecca shake hands with?

  Please note that everyone had met their partner prior to the party, and that
  no one shook hands with themselves.

answer: |
  Since their are ten people, and eight potentially unknown prior to the party,
  the nine different answers Rebecca gets has to be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and
  8.

  The person with 8 handshakes shook hands with everyone but herself and her
  partner. Number 0 must therfore be her partner.

  Number 7 shook hands with everyone besides herself, her partner and number 0.
  Number 1 only shook hands with number 8, so 7 and 1 must be partners.

  This can be continued, with 6 and 2 being partners, as well as 5 and 3.

  Rebecca must be partner with number 4 - the only one who is left - and she
  must herself have shook hands with 4 people: Number 8, 7, 6 and 5.

  The easiest way to arrive at this answer is to draw it as a graph, with each
  person as a node, and each handshake as an edge between the participants.
