  A girl leaves her home in the morning for school. She looks for the time on
  an old-fashioned, analog clock, through a mirror. Unfortunately there are no
  digits on the clock, so she mistakes the mirror image for the actual time.
  She rides her bike to school, which takes twenty minutes. When she arrives
  and looks at the school clock, it shows a time two-and-a-half hours later
  than the mirror image she saw at home.

  What was the time when she left home? What was the mirror image? And when did
  she arrive?

answer: |
  When she looks at the clock it is 12.10, and she sees 10.00. So, after twenty
  minutes of travelling the time is 12.30, which is 2.5 hours later than 10.00.
