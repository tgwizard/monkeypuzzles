  A girl leaves her home in the morning for school. She looks for the time on
  an old-fashioned, analog clock, through a mirror. Unfortunately there are no
  digits on the clock, so she mistakes the mirror image for the actual time.
  (She sees no difference between the two clock arms). She rides her bike to
  school, which takes 20 minutes. When she arrives and looks at the school
  clock, it shows a time two-and-a-half hours later than the mirror image.

  What was the time when she left home? What was the mirror image? And when did
  she arrive?

answer: |
  When she looks at the clock it is 12.10, and she sees 10.00. So, 20 minutes
  of travelling time the time is 12.30, which is 2.5 hours later than 10.00.
