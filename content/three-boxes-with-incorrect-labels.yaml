  You have three boxes in front of you, one with *nails* in it, one with
  *screws*, and one with both *nails and screws*. The boxes all have
  labels describing their contents. Unfortunately, all labels are incorrect,
  and describes one of the other boxes.

  You can pick up one item from one of the boxes (no peeking). How do you
  determine what is in each box? Put another way: From which box, with which
  label, do you take an item?

answer: |
  If you take an item from the box labeled *nails and screws*, two things
  could happen: You could get a nail or a screw. Since you know the label is
  wrong, you know that this box can only contain one type of item. If you get a
  nail, this box should be labeled *nails*, and vice versa.

  And, since all boxes were incorrectly labeled, you now know that the two
  remaining boxes should switch labels.
