  The great town wizard needs a new apprentice, and has announced a competition
  for the post. Many applicants have tried, and only the three brightest remain
  for the final challenge.

  The wizard gives each applicant a hat, and tells them that they have either a
  black or a white hat. The first one to figure out the color of her own hat
  and publicly announce it wins the challenge, and becomes the wizard's
  apprentice. Also, if any of them sees another applicant having a white hat,
  they are supposed to say:

  "I see someone with a white hat."

  However, the wizard, devious as she is, has given white hats to all three
  applicants. So, predictably, they all immediately announce that they see
  someone with a white hat, and then nothing happens for a while.

  But, after a few minutes of silence, the most clever of the applicants
  announces: I have a white hat! She becomes the wizard's apprentice, and
  everyone lives happily ever after.

  How can she know the color of her hat?

answer: |
  We can figure out the answer by walking through the four possible cases: No
  white hats, one white hat, two white hats, or, the case that actually took
  place, three white hats. Lets call the apprentices Aaron, Berta and Carlos.

  If there are no white hats, then no one will say the've seen a white hat.
  Since they all said that they can see a white hat, this isn't the case.

  If there is only one white hat, given to Aaron, then Berta and Carlos will
  immediately say that they see a white hat. Aaron will know that it must be
  his hat that they see, and so he will know the color of his own hat. This
  doesn't happen - they all see at least one white hat.

  If there are two white hats, given to Aaron and Berta, they will all see at
  least one white hat, and say so. Carlos won't know anything more, but Aaron
  and Berta can reason further. Since Aaron knows that Berta sees a white hat,
  it must be his hat, since Carlos' hat is black. The same goes for Berta. The
  quickest thinker of Aaron and Berta would claim to know their hat's color
  almost immediately, and the competition would be over.

  But this doesn't happen - no one immediately wins. Since the winner would
  know her color almost immediately in all these cases, they must all have
  white hats. The quickest of them will know, and win.
