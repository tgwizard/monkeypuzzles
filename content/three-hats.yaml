  The great town wizard needs a new apprentice, and has announced a competition
  for the post. Many applicants have tried, and only the three brightest remain
  for the last challenge.

  The wizard gives each applicant a hat, and tells them that they have either a
  black or a white hat. The first one to figure out the color of her own hat
  and publicly announce it wins the challenge, and becomes the wizard's
  apprentice. Also, if any of them sees another applicant having a white hat,
  they are supposed to say:

  "I see someone with a white hat."

  However, the wizard has been tricky, and given all three white hats. All
  three of the applicants announce that they see someone with a white hat, and
  then go quite.

  After a while, one of the applicants announces: I have a white hat and
  becomes the wizard's apprentice. How can she know the color of her hat?
