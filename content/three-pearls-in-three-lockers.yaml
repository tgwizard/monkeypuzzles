  There are three lockers, each with two drawers. Each drawer contains one item
  - a pearl, or a clump of coal.  In one locker both drawers contain pearls, in
  another both lockers contain clumps of coal. In the third locker one drawer
  contains a pearl, and the other contains a clump of coal.

  You do not know which locker is which. You open one drawer and find a pearl.
  If you are allowed to open one more drawer, which one should you open to
  maximise your chances of finding another pearl?

answer: |
  You should open the other drawer in the same locker as the first drawer you
  opened.

  To see why, look at it like this: If you open a drawer with a pearl in it,
  the probability that it is in the locker with two pearls is two in three, and
  one in three that it is in the locker with only one pearl. Since you are most
  likely in the two-pearl-locker, opening the other drawer in the same locker
  gives you the best chance of finding another pearl.
