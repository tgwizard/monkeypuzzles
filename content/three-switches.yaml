  There is a square room, empty but for an old-fashioned light bulb. One side
  of the room has a door, leading in. Outside the room there are three
  switches, one of them (you don't know which) lights the light bulb inside the
  room. All three switches are in their off setting to begin with, and the
  light bulb is dark.  You can turn on or off the switches as many times as you
  want, but you can not see if they affect the light bulb from the outside. You
  are allowed to enter the room only once.

  How do you determine which of the switches control the light bulb?

  Bah!
