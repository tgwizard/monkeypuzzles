  You have eight small stone balls, where one is slightly heavier than the
  others. You have an old-fashioned balancing scale. In as few weighings as
  possible, how do you find the heavier ball?

answer: |
  You need two weighings.

  First, weigh three balls against three balls. If they balance, the heavier is
  one of the remaining two, which you can find in the next weighing.

  Otherwise, one side was heavier in the first weighing, and one of those three
  balls must be heavier. For the second weighing, take two of those prospects
  and weigh them. If they balance, the one left out is heavier. If they don't
  balance, one of them is heavier, and it is the answer.
