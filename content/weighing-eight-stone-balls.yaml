  There are eight stone balls, where one is slightly heavier than the others.
  You have a old-fashioned balancing scale. In as few weighings as possible,
  how do you find the heavier ball?

answer: |
  You need two weighings.

  First, weigh three balls against three balls. If they balance, the heavier is
  one of the other two, which you can find in the next weighing.  If one side
  was heavier, then one of those three balls is heavier. For the second
  weighing, take two of the possibly heavier balls and weigh them. If they
  balance, the third is heavier. If they don't, then you have found the heavier
  one.
