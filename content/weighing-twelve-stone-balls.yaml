  You have twelve small stone balls, where one is of slightly different weight
  than the others, either lighter or heavier - you don't know. You have an
  old-fashioned balancing scale. In as few weighings as possible, how do you
  find the odd ball?

answer: |
  You need three weighings.

  In the first weighing, weigh four balls against four balls.

  If they balance, the odd ball must be one of the remaining four balls, and
  the eight balls in the first weighing are all of regular weight. For the
  second weighing, take two unknown balls and weigh them against two balls
  whose weights are known. If they balance, the odd ball is one of the other
  two balls. If they don't balance, one of the unknown balls on the scale is
  odd. For the third weighing, take one of the two unknown balls and weigh it
  against a regular ball. If they balance, the one left out is odd, otherwise
  it is the one on the scale.

  If the first weighing didn't balance, we have eight possibly odd balls and
  four regular ones. In the first weighing, one side was lower, and one side
  was higher, resulting in four balls that are possibly heavier and four balls
  that are possibly lighter than the others.

  For the second weighing, place two possibly-heavier balls and one
  possibly-lighter ball on the left side, and two possibly-heavier balls and
  one possibly-lighter ball on the right side.

  If the scale balances, one of the remaining two unknown balls - two
  possibly-lighter balls - is odd. Take one of them and balance it against a
  known ball, and the answer is given.

  If the scale didn't balance in the second weighing, then either the left side
  is lower than the right side, or vice versa. If the left side is lower, then
  one of the two possibly-heavier balls on the left side or the
  possibly-lighter on the right side is odd. And if the right side is lower,
  then one of the two possibly-heavier on the right side or the
  possibly-lighter on the left side is odd.

  In either case we have two possibly-heavier balls and one possibly-lighter
  balls remaining that could be odd. For the third weighing, take the
  possibly-lighter ball and one possibly-heavier ball and place them on the
  left side, and two regular balls on the right side. If the scale balances,
  the ball left out is odd. If the scale doesn't balance, then the
  possibly-heavier ball is odd if the left side is lower than the right side,
  and the possibly-lighter ball is odd if the left side is higher.

  (If anyone knows of a better way to present the answer to this puzzle, please
  contact us. Surely this can't be the best way to do it...)
